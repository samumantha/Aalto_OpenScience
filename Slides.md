# Data / Code available on request

* own good / bad experiences?

# FAIR to the rescue
 
F - indability
* persistant identifier
A - ccessability
* online link to the data and related metadata
* documented versioning and lifecycle
I - nteroperability
* open file formats and common standards
R - eusability
* rich metadata
* license

-> increasing impact and reliability of your work

# FAIR digital objects

# FAIR != Open

Data can be FAIR or Open, both or neither. The greatest benefits come when data are both FAIR and Open, as the
lack of restrictions supports the widest possible reuse, and reuse at scale. (https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2777/1524)

# Research data management

Why? 
* good scientific practice, helps you and others
* required by funding bodies
* merit, scientific credits

Aalto: publicly funded research has to be open , if possible

# Research data service considerations

* domain specific/organizational repository available?
* sensitive data?
* intended data usage?
* maintainer?
* interfaces needed?
* storage space needs? (individual size?)
* automated file transfer?
* metadata needs?
* security needs?

# Good repository?

Established
•
Good metadata
•
Curation and preservation
•
Open and machine readable
•
Registry of Research Data Repositories: 
re3data.org 
# How to find good repository?

1.
Look for the Core trust seal and how the service looks like
2.
Can you search, find and evaluate data from the repository yourself?
3.
Would and could you use it yourself?


# FAIRdata services

store - describe - search 

(latter part of research data life cycle)

* Smooth transition between the separate services
    * Single sign-in to the services
    * Descriptive metadata passage between services

* Available (METAX)
    * Storage service IDA
    * Metadata tool Qvain
    * Finder/Viewer Etsin
    * Digital preservation service Fairdata PAS

# IDA


* stable research data, 
* both raw data and processed data, 
* free of charge to users affiliated with Finnish universities and polytechnics, Finnish research institutes and research funded by the Academy of Finland.

* staging -> freezing area

# Qvain

https://www.fairdata.fi/en/qvain/qvain-user-guide/

Metadata
description

Create(s) a descriptive metadata for research datasets to 
improve their finadbility

-> describe and publish with the Qvain tool
-> who has produced the data, its topic, keywords and licenses

# Etsin

PID and landing page
ensurance that metadata is available even if data is no longer

# Digital preservation

reliable preservation

# Paituli


# Licensing

# Workflow

scripting helps
workflow tools / bash scripts
environment - virtual environments / containers with recipes

ie moving to Puhti gives you a headstart

Reproducible
https://coderefinery.github.io/reproducible-research/


# What can I do right now?

#from https://www.fairdata.fi/en/about-fairdata/benefits/

* Research plan /RDM - keep up to date
* document each dataset 
* think about future storage
* get PID for dataset and use it
* use services that support FAIR principles
